# **Aerocord**
My own project to bring Aero Glass to Discord.

THIS WILL BE THE OFFICIAL Aerocord GitHub repository!!! If you want the first version (Alpha v1.0.1), you need t follow this link: https://github.com/DrCreeper-YT/Aerocord-Alpha-

**Alpha v1.0.2 available now!!!**
Changes:
- Texts are now more read-able than they were before in Alpha v1.0.1.
- If you use ChannelTabs, it'll now be more shrunk to have a more compact experience.
- The normal Discord buttons have been removed! (But sadly you won't be able to fullscreen the window for now).
- Some interfaces have been fixed for LIGHT MODE. For now it's loght-mode exclisve, but, if you have a dark enough wallpaper, I think you can handle it, right? ...right?
